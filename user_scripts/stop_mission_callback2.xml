<!--
Used during a mission to transfer sbd and tbd files to the dockserver, transfer an .ma
file to the glider, and then re-read the ma file and resume the mission.

To change the .ma file sent to the glider, search for two occurances of 'gotoTest.ma' and
replace with desired filename.  Note this script expects this .ma file to be in the glider's
'to-glider' folder on the dockserver machine.

For use with dockserver version 1.5 and up.

Note: This script has transitions based on loss of Carrier Detect.  It may not behave correctly with
communications that do NOT support Carrier Detect.
